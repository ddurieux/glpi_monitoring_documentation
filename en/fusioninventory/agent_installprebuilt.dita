  <shortdesc>How to use a prebuilt version of the FusionInventory agent.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Prebuilt versions of the agent are also maintained by the project, allowing you to launch the agent without performing any installation on your system. This method involves four steps:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Download the appropriate prebuilt version for your operating system at the following address: <xref href="http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/" format="html">http://prebuilt.fusioninventory.org/stable/</xref>;</li>
      <li>Uncompress the downloaded archive;</li>
      <li>Configure the agent by editing the agent.cfg file;</li>
      <li>
        <p>Launch the agent as <i>root</i> with the following command :</p>
        <codeblock>./fusioninventory-agent</codeblock>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p><note>the FusionInventory project recommends using packages (deb, rpm, etc) when possible. Prebuilt versions are interesting for testing purposes, or when you have no possibility to install packages on your system.</note></p>
