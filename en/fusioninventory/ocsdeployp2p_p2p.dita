  <title>How peer 2 peer deployment feature works</title>
  <shortdesc>How the peer 2 peer feature works</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Peer 2 peer (P2P) allows: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>To reduce bandwidth between central server and the computer (useful in the case of a remote site)</li>
      <li>To get files very quickly</li>
    </ul>
    <p>How it works: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The first client downloads the fragments of a package from the central server.</li>
      <li>The other computers check whether agents from other clients on the local site have these fragments. Depending on the answers the agent gets:<ul>
          <li>if the fragments are found on other computers, then they are downloaded (they will then only be downloaded from the local site)</li>
          <li>if the fragments are not found on other agents / systems, then they will be downloaded from the central server.</li>
        </ul></li>
    </ul>
    <p>During a deployment on several machines located on the same site, you can see a significant improvement in bandwidth usage.</p>
    <note>With the P2P feature you can e.g. avoid having local server with synchronization to a remote master server. Etc. In this case you can start automated application deployment without changing the architecture of an already present network.</note>
